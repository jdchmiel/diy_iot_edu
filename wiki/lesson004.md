#BREADBOARD

[build an arduino on a breadboard](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Standalone)
This is a great tutorial that teaches the fundamentals of a breadboard.
Chances are you do not have all of the components ffor this laying around and will not be able to follow it verbatim.  Reading it and understanding it, and then playing with your breadboards a bit are the goal.  If anyone does want to follow it verbatim, order some components / beg borrow steal from me / each other to get everything needed.  I think I have everything to give / loan except the crystal and I have a different voltage regulator.



#TAKEAWAY
* If you follow the full tutorial you have built an arduino capable of running sketches.
* You know the structure of a breadboard pin connection
* You are getting a picture of what additional components might be a good idea to buy and have on hand.
