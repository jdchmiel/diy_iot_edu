First Lesson:

Goal is to use the Ardunio IDE to program an ardunio.  Some of us do not have a regular arduino that has USB port so there are alternate ways.

I followed this tutorial: http://www.instructables.com/id/Uploading-sketch-to-Arduino-Pro-Mini-using-Arduino/?ALLSTEPS
And was able to program blinky onto two arduino pro mini boars, as well as the Arduino Uno once I put the chip back into it.

Total time was about an hour for me, including finding the soldering iron, soldering them to the mini's, making jumper wires out of
an old PC CD ROM audio cable, and then doing the actual flashing.
